Snakes and Ladders

A solo snakes and ladders game that gives you tasks based on the square you land.

A simple snakes and ladders game written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript. This is a single player game where each square you land on gives you a task to complete. Tasks are customizable in using a JSON file.

Roll the dice to move your token around the board.
If you land on a square with a task, complete the task.

To customize the tasks, open the tasks.json file and edit the tasks to your liking.

I've taken this as far as I can in terms of features. I would love the community to improve on this.
